Setup
=====

This section describes various deployment scenarios for Cuneiform. The most
direct way to start Cuneiform is to
`download the jar <http://www.cuneiform-lang.org/download/>`_ it and run it right
away. Apart from that, there are a number of alternative deployment methods
which are documented here.

.. hint::
   There are more deployment options for Cuneiform not documented here. In
   particular the setup with `Hi-WAY <https://github.com/marcbux/Hi-WAY>`_ in
   clusters and clouds using `Karamel <http://www.karamel.io/>`_ instead of Chef
   is an important topic not covered in this documentation. Please refer to the
   `Saasfee <http://www.saasfee.io/>`_ website for further information.
